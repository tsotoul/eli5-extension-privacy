  <h1>üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Policy ‚Äì Explain Like I‚Äôm 5</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 07/07/2025</p>
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>We value your privacy. This policy explains how the Explain Like I‚Äôm 5 Chrome extension handles your data. We aim to be transparent, simple, and respectful of your trust.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The extension only collects information that you actively provide by highlighting text on a web page and choosing to request an explanation.

  Specifically:
    Selected Text: When you highlight text and click the brain icon, the selected text is sent to a secure backend server for processing via OpenAI‚Äôs API.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>The selected text is used solely to generate a simplified explanation using artificial intelligence (AI).
  We do not:

  - Track browsing activity

  - Store any personal or identifiable information

  - Use cookies or trackers

  - Sell or share your data with third parties</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Retentiony</h2>
  <p>We do not store any selected text or explanation results. All processing is transient and occurs in real-time. Once a response is generated and shown to you, it is not retained.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the OpenAI API to generate explanations. The selected text is temporarily sent to OpenAI's API for processing. OpenAI‚Äôs own privacy policy applies to that use.

  We also use a secure Azure-hosted backend to relay these requests. No tracking or storage occurs on this server.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
  <p>By using the extension, you consent to the temporary processing of highlighted text to receive AI-generated explanations. You can stop using the extension at any time to withdraw consent.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All communication between the extension and the backend is secured via HTTPS. We follow industry best practices to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of data.</p>

  <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This extension is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from minor</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy in the future. If we do, a notice will be included in the extension update and on our website.</p>
